title: Two VSCode extensions for easier Testing with Jest
subtitle: 'CodeStudio is an extension pack for VSCODE that bundles several extensions (frontend) developers into one install. I created this extension for two reasons, the first to teach myself how to, the second, to scratch an itch that I had trying to figure out the quickest to get VSCODE from install to work ready.'
