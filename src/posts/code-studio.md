I created this extension for two reasons, the first to teach myself how to, the second, to scratch an itch that I had trying to figure out the quickest to get VSCODE from install to work ready. I managed to do both, YAY me :)!

> Performance note. I have been able to comfortably run (39+) extensions on a surfacebook pro i5 8gb of ram 256gb hd , lets say I like pushing it. If you are multitasking or run a lot of memory hungry apps (Chrome...), I would recommend that you go with something a bit more powerful.
