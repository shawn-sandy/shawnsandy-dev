Your heard me right native HTML5 dialogs are here and available across all evergreen browsers and they are fun. Well actually its the `<dialog>` element [you check out the info here](). Warning it does require a bit of javascript to work. But most of the functionality you need to create a modal come out of the box.

!['Modal preview']({{ hlp.sharp.img(['modal-preview.png'])}})
